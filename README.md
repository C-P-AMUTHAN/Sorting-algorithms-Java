# Java Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of widely-used sorting algorithms in Java. These algorithms are essential for data organization, problem-solving, and performance optimization in software development.

## Algorithms Included

- **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm where adjacent elements are swapped if they are in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort**: Sorts by repeatedly selecting the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the array.
- **Insertion Sort**: Builds the sorted array one item at a time, inserting elements into their correct position.
- **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array and merges it back in sorted order.
- **Quick Sort**: Efficient sorting algorithm using partitioning and recursion.
- **Heap Sort**: Uses a binary heap structure to sort the elements.
- **Radix Sort**: A non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts numbers digit by digit.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/C-P-AMUTHAN/Sorting-algorithms-Java.git
